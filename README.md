ðŸ““ Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Custom Data
ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

This project aims to build a complete handwritten digit recognition pipeline trained on custom digit samples captured using a mobile phone camera. The goal is to develop an end-to-end system that:

    Collects and processes real-world handwritten digits

    Trains a model to recognize them accurately

    Predicts digits from new input via webcam or image upload

ðŸ§­ Project Roadmap
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Data Collection

    Objective: Build a diverse dataset of your own handwriting (and optionally, others').

    Plan:

        Use your phone's camera to take photos of handwritten digits (0â€“9).

        Write each digit clearly in multiple styles, sizes, and angles.

        Ensure high contrast (white paper, dark pen).

        Collect at least 200â€“500 samples per digit to start (~2,000â€“5,000 total).

        Organize into folders: data/0, data/1, ..., data/9.

    Tools/Concepts to Learn:

        File naming and organization

        Image labeling (youâ€™ll use folder names)

        Smartphone scanning (or image cropping apps)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Data Preprocessing

    Objective: Convert raw photos into model-ready 28Ã—28 grayscale images.

    Steps:

        Convert to grayscale

        Resize to 28Ã—28 (MNIST format)

        Normalize pixel values (0 to 1)

        Optionally apply thresholding, blurring, or centering

    Topics to Know:

        Image processing basics

        OpenCV and NumPy

        Image augmentation (rotation, noise, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Model Building

    Objective: Train a neural network to classify digits from your dataset.

    Recommended Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

        Works well with images

        Learns features like edges and curves

    Tools & Libraries:

        TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

        Scikit-learn (optional for evaluation)

    Topics to Learn:

        CNN architecture (Conv â†’ ReLU â†’ Pooling â†’ Dense)

        Loss functions (Categorical Crossentropy)

        Optimizers (Adam)

        Epochs, batch size, validation split

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Evaluation and Testing

    Objective: Measure how well the model generalizes to new, unseen samples.

    Steps:

        Split your data into train, validation, and test sets

        Visualize confusion matrix

        Analyze failure cases (e.g., misclassified digits)

    Goal: Achieve at least 90% accuracy on your test set.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Deployment

    Objective: Predict handwritten digits from new inputs (webcam or image).

    Features:

        Webcam-based prediction

        Image upload for testing

        Real-time digit drawing using mouse or touchscreen

    Topics to Learn:

        OpenCV (for webcam capture)

        Streamlit / Gradio / Flask (for web UI)

        Model saving/loading (using model.save() / pickle)
